# RPM build

some packages are not available in the standard fedora repositories.
since i don't want to use copr repos, i build the rpms locally.
The spec-files are mainly from:

- <https://github.com/solopasha/hyprlandRPM>
- <https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/yalter/niri/>

# TODO

Adjust hypr\*, niri
